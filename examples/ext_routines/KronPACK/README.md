# KronPACK #

The **KronPACK** package collects all the functions and the scripts needed to
perform the tensor operations and to reproduce the numerical examples contained
in the manuscript

[M. Caliari, F. Cassini, and F. Zivcovich, A mu-mode BLAS approach for
multidimensional tensor-structured problems](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11075-022-01399-4)

It is written in MATLAB language and it is fully compatible with GNU Octave.

Here we copy just the relevant functions of the package, i.e., **kronsum.m**,
**kronsumv.m** and **mump.m**.
