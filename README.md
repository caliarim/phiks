# PHIKS -- PHI-functions of Kronecker Sums  #

The **PHIKS** algorithm computes actions of phi-functions for Kronecker sums
of arbitrary matrices using a mu-mode approach. It is based on the
approximation of the integral representation of the phi-functions by
Gaussian quadrature formulas, combined with a scaling and squaring technique.

integrators: actions of phi-functions of Kronecker sums](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07667)

This GitHub repository contains a MATLAB implementation of **PHIKS** (fully
compatible with GNU Octave) and all the functions and the scripts needed to
reproduce the numerical examples contained in the reference manuscript.
